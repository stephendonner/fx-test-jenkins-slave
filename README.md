Experimental repo (for now) as work through trying to dynamically provision a Jenkins slave node.

We'll likely also be integrating with:
* https://github.com/mozilla-services/fx-test-pubkeys
* https://github.com/rpappalax/fx-test-jenkins - specifically, its [provision-common.sh](https://github.com/rpappalax/fx-test-jenkins/blob/92c3d954d729e47e1466bdc3f4464bdb11df7573/provision-common.sh) shell script
